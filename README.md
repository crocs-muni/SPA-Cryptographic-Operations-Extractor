# 2019-SBAPR-CryptoOperationsExtractor

This programme was created as a part of a Bachelor thesis.
It serves to extract powertraces of cryptographic oprations measured on smart cards depedning on the delimiting operation.
It takes a folder containing CSV files of obtained power traces by using Simple Power Analysis as an input.
Each cryptographic operation should be delimited by some delimiting operation (i.e. generation of random numbers).

Applet containing functionality this programme was customized to is on the link https://github.com/martinftlsx/SBAPR-2019-JCApplet.
